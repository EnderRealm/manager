# Frontend sync status indicator

Display sync status on dashboard project tiles and project detail header. Handle sync-status SSE events.

## Design

Files: src/client/hooks/useTicketEvents.ts, src/client/components/ (dashboard tile and project header components)

useTicketEvents.ts:
- Add sync-status event listener that invalidates the ['projects'] query key so project summaries refetch with new sync status.

Dashboard project tiles:
- Show nothing when synced (normal state).
- Show subtle sync icon when pending.
- Show warning indicator when error, with error reason on hover/tap.

Project detail header:
- Same indicator near existing branch/dirty status, slightly more prominent.

No toasts, no modals. Persistent indicator that clears on recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

Sync errors visible on dashboard and project detail. Pending state shows subtle indicator. Synced state shows nothing. Error reason accessible via hover/tap.
