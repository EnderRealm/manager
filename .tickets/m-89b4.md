# Display build version on dashboard

Add a version identifier to the server and display it on the dashboard home page. Makes it easy to verify which commit is running in production after a deploy.

## Design

Approach: Use the git commit short hash as the version identifier. The deployer already runs a build step (vite build) — inject the commit hash at build time via an env variable or vite define.

Server side:
- Add a /api/version endpoint that returns the current git commit hash (read at startup via git rev-parse --short HEAD, or baked in at build time)

Frontend:
- Display the version string on the dashboard, likely in the footer or header — small and unobtrusive
- Fetch from /api/version or use a build-time constant injected by vite define

Build pipeline:
- In deployer.sh or vite.config.ts, inject VITE_BUILD_VERSION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) so the frontend knows the version without an API call

Each push/deploy naturally gets a new version since it's the commit hash. No manual version bumping needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

Dashboard shows current commit hash. After a deploy, refreshing the page shows the new hash. Version is also available via /api/version.
