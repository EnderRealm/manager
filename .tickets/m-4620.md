# Board View: ticket list doesn’t scroll on mobile


## Notes

**2026-02-15T22:31:04Z**

Root cause: ProjectView.tsx had overflow:hidden on the view content wrapper (flex:1 container). This clipped the KanbanBoard mobile ticket list at the viewport height. Fixed to overflow:auto so the list scrolls within the flex layout, keeping header and tabs pinned.
