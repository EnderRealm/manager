## Implementation Plan

### Data Model

- Config.groups?: ProjectGroup[] for display order
- Ungrouped projects shown at end

### Steps

2. Server: types + loadGroups/saveGroups helpers
3. API: GET/PUT /api/config/groups
4. Client: useGroups.ts hook
5. Dashboard: DndContext + SortableContext wrapper
6. New ProjectGroupSection component
7. ProjectTile: Add useSortable support
