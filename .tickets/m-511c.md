# Add sync status to projects API and SSE events

Expose sync status in the projects API response and broadcast sync status changes over SSE.

## Design

Files: src/server/routes/projects.ts, src/server/routes/events.ts

projects.ts:
- In getProjectSummary(), call getSyncStatus(projectId) and include it in the response object alongside existing git info.

events.ts:
- Subscribe to onSyncStatusChange() in the SSE stream handler (same pattern as onTicketChange and onStatusChange).
- Emit 'sync-status' events with { projectId, state, error?, lastSynced? }.
- Unsubscribe on stream abort.

## Acceptance Criteria

GET /api/projects returns syncStatus per project. SSE stream emits sync-status events on state transitions. Dashboard and detail views have the data they need.
