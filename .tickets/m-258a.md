# Implement dependency removal via drag-to-column

Dragging a dependent card to a column removes the dependency and sets status

## Design

Files: src/client/components/KanbanBoard.tsx

Changes to handleDragEnd:
- Detect if dragged item is a dependent (has parent relationship)
- If dropped on column (not card): remove dependency + change status
- Call removeDependency mutation then status mutation

API:
- New endpoint or tk CLI: tk undep <child-id> <parent-id>
- Chain with existing start/close/reopen mutations

Behavior:
- Drag child from under parent to Ready column -> remove dep, set status open
- Drag child to In Progress -> remove dep, set status in_progress
- Drag child to Closed -> remove dep, set status closed
- Blocked column: not a valid target (silent reject)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dragging dependent to column removes dependency relationship
- Status changes to match target column
- Card appears as top-level in new column
- Blocked column rejects drops
