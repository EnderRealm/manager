# Project API routes

API endpoints for listing and getting project details

## Design

Files: src/server/routes/projects.ts

Endpoints:
- GET /api/projects
  - Load config, for each project get: git status, language, ticket counts
  - Return array of ProjectSummary

- GET /api/projects/:id
  - Get single project with full details

Types:
- ProjectSummary: { id, name, path, branch, isDirty, language, ticketCounts: { inProgress, ready, blocked, open, closed } }

## Acceptance Criteria

- Returns all configured projects with stats
- Invalid project ID returns 404
