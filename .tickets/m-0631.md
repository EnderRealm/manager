# Add deployment workflow to CLAUDE.md

Document the production deployment workflow in CLAUDE.md so it's clear that pushing to main is the deploy step. We incorrectly tried to run the deployer script locally instead of understanding the Mac Studio picks up changes automatically via a launchd job.

## Design

File: CLAUDE.md

Add a Deployment section documenting:
- Production runs on Mac Studio at ~/.local/services/manager
- Deployment is automatic: push to origin/main, launchd job runs deployer.sh
- Do not run deployer.sh locally — pushing is the only deploy step from a dev machine

## Acceptance Criteria

CLAUDE.md has a Deployment section. No ambiguity about how to deploy.
