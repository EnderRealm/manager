# Dependency Graph Visualization

Interactive DAG visualization of ticket dependencies within a project. Renders deps and links as a directed graph for instant critical-path analysis and blocker identification. Leverages existing ticket dep/link data.

## Design

## Components

### Graph Layout
- DAG layout algorithm (Sugiyama/layered or force-directed)
- Lightweight library: dagre-d3, elkjs, or custom canvas rendering
- Nodes = tickets (colored by status/type), edges = dependencies
- Highlight critical path (longest chain of unresolved deps)

### Frontend
- New tab in ProjectView alongside Board/Table/Services
- Or: accessible from Board view via toggle button
- Interactive: click node to open ticket detail, hover for summary
- Zoom/pan for large graphs
- Filter by status (hide closed tickets) and type
- Highlight a ticket's upstream/downstream deps on selection

### Backend
- GET /api/projects/:id/tickets/graph — returns nodes + edges structure
- Or: compute client-side from existing ticket data (deps field)
- Include transitive dependency calculation for critical path

### Visual Design
- Node colors match existing type/status badge colors from theme
- Edge styles: solid for deps, dashed for links
- Blocked tickets highlighted with warning indicator
- Layout direction: left-to-right (deps flow left to right)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Graph renders all open tickets with their dependency relationships
- Can click a ticket node to view its details
- Can identify blocked tickets and their blockers visually
- Critical path is highlighted
- Can filter/hide closed tickets
- Zoom and pan works smoothly
- Graph updates when tickets change (via SSE)
