# Child tickets don't move to correct column when status changes

When a child ticket is closed, it stays nested under its parent instead of moving to the Closed column. Same issue exists for in_progress children - they should appear in their status column, not nested under parent. Child tickets should only be nested when they're in 'open' status.
