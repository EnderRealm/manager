# Integration tests for API

Integration tests for all API endpoints

## Design

Files: tests/integration/api.test.ts, tests/fixtures/

Setup:
- Create temp directory with mock .tickets/ files
- Point config at test directory

Tests:
- GET /api/projects returns project list
- GET /api/projects/:id/tickets returns tickets
- POST create ticket, verify in list
- Status transitions work correctly
- Error cases: invalid project, invalid ticket ID

Use vitest with fetch for HTTP calls

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints have test coverage
- Tests pass with mock data
- Error cases verified
