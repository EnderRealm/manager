# Project scaffolding

Initialize Bun project with TypeScript, Vite, and required dependencies

## Design

Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, .gitignore

Steps:
1. bun init
2. Add dependencies: hono, pino, pino-pretty, linguist-js, react, react-dom, @tanstack/react-query, react-router-dom
3. Add dev dependencies: vite, @vitejs/plugin-react, typescript, @types/react, @types/react-dom, vitest
4. Configure tsconfig for both server and client
5. Configure Vite for React with proxy to API server
6. Update .gitignore for logs/, node_modules/, dist/

## Acceptance Criteria

- bun install succeeds
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Vite dev server starts
