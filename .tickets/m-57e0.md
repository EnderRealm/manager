# Deploy notification webhook receiver

Add an endpoint that receives deploy webhook calls from service deployers (Tracker, Manager, etc). Store deploy history (service, commits, timestamp) and surface in the Manager UI as a deploy feed/timeline. Enables real-time deploy visibility across all managed services.
