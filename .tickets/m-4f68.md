# New Ticket: doesn’t scale down for mobile


## Notes

**2026-02-15T22:31:02Z**

Root cause: Three issues. (1) inputBase fontSize was 14px, triggering iOS Safari auto-zoom on input focus. Fixed to 16px. (2) SlideOutPanel maxWidth used 100vw which includes scrollbar width on iOS. Fixed to 100%. (3) Header search button overflowed 5px past viewport on mobile. Fixed by hiding Search text on mobile (show only cmd-K icon) and adding overflow:hidden on header.
