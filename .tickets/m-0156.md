# Create compact DependentCard component

New component for displaying dependent tickets inline under their blockers

## Design

Files: src/client/components/DependentCard.tsx (new)

Props:
- ticket: Ticket
- onDragStart/onDragEnd handlers
- onClick handler

Layout:
- Same header structure as TicketCard (ID/Type/Priority)
- Title truncated to single line with ellipsis
- Indented styling (margin-left ~16-20px)
- Muted/smaller appearance to show hierarchy
- Left border indicator preserved
- Draggable for dependency removal

Styling:
- Slightly smaller font size or opacity reduction
- Clear visual subordination to parent card

## Acceptance Criteria

- Component renders ticket with truncated title
- Visually distinct from parent cards (indented, muted)
- Draggable with same drag handlers as TicketCard
