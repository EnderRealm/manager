# Trigger git sync from file watcher for non-API ticket changes


## Notes

**2026-02-22T03:58:35Z**

Ticket changes made outside the manager API (tk CLI, Claude Code agents, manual edits) are detected by the file watcher but don't trigger git sync. Hook into onTicketChange in watcher.ts to call scheduleSyncForProject, so any .tickets/ file change — regardless of source — gets committed and pushed after the 30s debounce.
