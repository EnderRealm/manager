# Dashboard: when you return from ticket view on mobile dashboard is sized bigger than screen


## Notes

**2026-02-15T22:31:06Z**

Root cause: Same as m-4f68. Header search button overflowed 5px past the viewport. iOS Safari zoomed out to accommodate, and the zoom state persisted across navigation. Fixed by the header overflow fix in m-4f68.
