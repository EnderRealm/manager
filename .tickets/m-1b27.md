# Frontend foundation - Vite, React, routing

Set up React app with routing and React Query

## Design

Files: src/client/main.tsx, src/client/App.tsx, src/client/lib/api.ts, index.html

src/client/main.tsx:
- React 18 createRoot
- QueryClientProvider
- BrowserRouter

src/client/App.tsx:
- Routes: / (Dashboard), /projects/:id (Kanban)
- Basic layout wrapper

src/client/lib/api.ts:
- Fetch wrapper for /api endpoints
- Functions: getProjects, getProject, getTickets, createTicket, etc.

index.html:
- Root div, script tag for main.tsx

## Acceptance Criteria

- React app renders
- Routing between pages works
- API client functions typed correctly
