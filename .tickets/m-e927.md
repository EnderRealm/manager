# Implement inline dependency display in columns

Show dependent tickets nested under their blockers in Kanban columns

## Design

Files: src/client/components/KanbanBoard.tsx, src/client/components/KanbanColumn.tsx

Changes to KanbanBoard.tsx:
- Build dependency map: for each ticket, collect its direct dependents
- Pass dependents data to KanbanColumn
- Filter: dependents should NOT appear as top-level cards (avoid duplicates)

Changes to KanbanColumn.tsx:
- After rendering each TicketCard, render its DependentCards
- Only for In Progress, Ready, Closed columns (not Blocked)
- Maximum one level of nesting

Data flow:
1. Fetch all tickets
2. Build map: blockerId -> [dependentTickets]
3. For each column, render blocker cards with their dependents inline
4. Blocked column renders flat list (existing behavior)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dependent tickets appear indented under blockers
- Only one level of nesting shown
- Blocked column remains flat
- No duplicate cards (dependents only shown under blockers)
