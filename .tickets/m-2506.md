# Tickets-only sync via separate worktree/branch

Manager should sync .tickets/ via a separate mechanism (dedicated branch, bare clone, or worktree) so it never touches the main working tree. This enables real-time ticket sync across machines without conflicting with active development. Requires design work — run /brainstorm before implementing.
