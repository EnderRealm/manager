## Project Notes

Project: manager - tk ticket dashboard

Decisions made:
- Full CRUD web UI for managing tk tickets across multiple local repos
- Stack: TypeScript + React frontend, Hono backend, Bun runtime
- Data: Direct file access to .tickets/ directories (no DB caching)
- Config: Point to repos via config file

Key insight: tk stores tickets as markdown files in .tickets/ directory. The app just needs to shell out to `tk` commands or read/write the files directly. Direct file access keeps things simple and always in sync.

Architecture emerging:
- Backend: Hono server that wraps tk commands or manipulates .tickets/ files
- Frontend: React SPA for viewing/managing tickets
- Config: JSON/YAML file listing repo paths
